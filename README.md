# Trello Kanban

This is a side project for practicing functional programming using:

- RxJS & Cycle.js, as the core framework
- Ramda, as a utils lib
- Tape, for testing
- Brunch, to automate things

The use case I would like to solve is to generate Cumulative Flow Diagram for a Kanban-like Trello board.

I will apply this to the boards we use at Metidia to help me generate these reports, handling our specific use cases as they arise.

## Install

Install brunch & bower

```
npm install -g bower brunch
```

## Usage

```
brunch watch --server
```
