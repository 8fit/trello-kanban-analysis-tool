# Contributing to TKAT

Glad to hear you'd like to help improving the library. Here's the how-to!

## Wanna report an issue / ask for a feature?

Sounds nice! Please proceed as following:

1. **Search for existing issues.** Sometimes, other folks may have reported the same issue and it'd be nice not to duplicate them.
2. If possible, please **create an isolated and reproducible test case**. You can make use of [jsFiddle](jsfiddle.net) - for instance - to share your isolated test cases. We won't hold it against you for feature requests, but a live [POC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_concept) is sometimes easier to catch.
3. **Share as much information as possible**. Where appropriate, include browser and version, version of TKATâ€¦ That can help to reproduce the bug, if so.

## Or wanna contribute to the code?

Github's Pull Request is a fantastic tool to contribute to the code.

Actually, this project is following [the GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/):

1. Create a branch
2. Add commits
3. Open a Pull Request
4. Discuss and review your code
5. Deploy
6. Merge

Just keep in mind the following rules:

- You'd be nice not to pollute your pull request with unintended changes.
- Pull requests should always be against the `develop` branch, never against `master` nor `gh-pages`.

Once you send a Pull Request, your code will be check with [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/nicoespeon/trello-kanban-analysis-tool) to tell whether you break the build or not. The Travis test should pass before we accept any Pull Request.

## Check about our coding standards

Please follow our coding standards as best as you can to keep consistency over code.

The [.editorconfig](https://github.com/nicoespeon/trello-kanban-analysis-tool/blob/develop/.editorconfig) file should help you configure your IDE to do so.

### JS (ES2015)

This project uses [ESLint](http://eslint.org/) to ensure consistency, following [these rules(https://github.com/nicoespeon/trello-kanban-analysis-tool/blob/develop/.eslintrc.js)

You can run the linter with `npm run lint`.

### CSS (SASS)

There is no linter for stylesheet yet.

As a rule of thumb however, here are a few advices:

- Multiple-line approach (one property and value per line)
- Always a space after a property's colon (.e.g, `display: block;` and not `display:block;`)
- End all lines with a semi-colon
- For multiple, comma-separated selectors, place each selector on its own line
- Attribute selectors, like `input[type="text"]`, should always wrap the attribute's value in double quotes, for consistency and safety (see [this blog post on unquoted attribute values](http://mathiasbynens.be/notes/unquoted-attribute-values) that can lead to XSS attacks).

### HTML

There is no linter for HTML yet.

As a rule of thumb however, here are a few advices:

- Two spaces for indentation, never tabs
- Double quotes only, never single quotes
- Always use proper indentation
- Use tags and elements valid for an HTML5 doctype
